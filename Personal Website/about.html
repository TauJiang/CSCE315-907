							<p>Greeting from Aggieland!<br>
                                I am a computer engineering senior with emphasis in computer science and
                                    minor in engineering project management from <a class="active" href="https://www.tamu.edu/">TAMU</a>. I always have a broad dream that is to use computer 
                                    science to make the life of people more convenient. Because of the feeling that I have the s
                                    ocial responsibility to make a better world with others, I participate in a lot of social 
                                    works. Model United Nations is one of it. In the summer of 2019, I volunteered in a primary 
                                    school located only about 3 miles away from Thai-Cambodia border to enrich English education.
                                     Without expectation in living quality, my mind was fulfilled by accomplishment. I then dance 
                                     and acting in front of hundreds of people. Those dances includes k-pop, Chinese tradition and 
                                     breaking. Things above are my social life, but talking about why continue pursuing more knowledge,
                                      it is another story.

						<div class="content">
							<p>I came to United States two years ago. In the choice between mathematics and 
                                computer engineering, I chose the computer engineering. Then I self-recommended to be the treasurer of
                                 a new erected robotics club <a class="active" href="https://www.tamurobomasters.com/">Robomaster Robotics</a>. I have less idea about managing club money as a 
                                 freshman, but I am confident because of success in the marketing of MUN in high school. After this,
                                  I have close contact with those passionate engineers with multiple strengths to build totally 6 
                                  combating robots. It was a great success that one year after we built them and get into the 
                                  Robomaster competition held my DJI with a funding about 3900 dollars plus club fees tens of 
                                  dollars per person. After came back from China, we enlarged our team and became more professional 
                                  and specialized. I became an embedded system engineer. I learnt a lot of things outside of the 
                                  classroom. It is a memorable experience when we try to make the 4 wheels of the robot spin 
                                  accordingly and using the simulation program to have a team fight together.
