    Thanks President Pitzer, Mr. Vice President, Governor, Congressman Thomas, Senator Wiley, and Congressman
        Miller, Mr. Webb, Mr. Bell, scientists, distinguished guests, and ladies and gentlemen:

        I appreciate your president having made me an honorary visiting professor, and I will assure you that my first
        lecture will be very brief.

        I am delighted to be here, and I'm particularly delighted to be here on this occasion.

        We meet at a college noted for knowledge, in a city noted for progress, in a State noted for strength, and we
        stand in need of all three, for we meet in an hour of change and challenge, in a decade of hope and fear, in an
        age of both knowledge and ignorance. The greater our knowledge increases, the greater our ignorance unfolds.

        Despite the striking fact that most of the scientists that the world has ever known are alive and working today,
        despite the fact that this Nation¹s own scientific manpower is doubling every 12 years in a rate of growth more
        than three times that of our population as a whole, despite that, the vast stretches of the unknown and the
        unanswered and the unfinished still far outstrip our collective comprehension.
        I appreciate your president having made me an honorary visiting professor, and I will assure you that my first
